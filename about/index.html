	<h1>Irene Iodice</h1>
	<p>I am a PhD student enrolled in a program of cotutelle between <em>Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies</em> and <em>Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne</em>. My research interests include industrial organization, empirical analysis of firm performance and its link with diversification strategies, micro and non-parametric econometrics, and the dynamics of international trade.
	My PhD thesis is part of a research project in which we are developing several instruments to treat and study multiproducts firms as products vectors.  </p>
